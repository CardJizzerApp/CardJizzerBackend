## What Is Cards Against Humanity? And Why CardJizzer?
It is a [game][cards-against-humanity], with its [game rules][game-rules] invented by a Kickstarter campaign in the year 2011.
This game is a real life card game and only playable if you are in one room - at least until now.

We decided to bring fresh air in this game and created this hybrid app which allows anybody to play
this beautiful game anywhere and anytime.
